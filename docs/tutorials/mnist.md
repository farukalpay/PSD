# MNIST Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates training a neural network on the MNIST dataset
using the ``PSDOptimizer``.

```bash
python examples/train_mnist.py
```

The script downloads MNIST and performs a small number of training epochs.
Inspect ``examples/train_mnist.py`` for the full end-to-end example.
