# Project Assessment

> This document captures an automated assessment of the repository's initial community and packaging status. It is retained for educational purposes and is not part of the contribution guidelines.

Short answer: **right now, usage looks minimal** and it’s unlikely to see casual adoption beyond people who want to reproduce the paper **unless** it’s packaged and documented more like a library.

**Evidence from the repo (today):**

* **0 stars, 0 forks, 0 issues, 0 pull requests** → little external engagement so far. ([GitHub][1])
* **MIT license shown** on GitHub **but** the README also says “This code is released for academic use only” → mixed licensing signals that can deter users. ([GitHub][1])
* **No releases or packages published**; no PyPI install. ([GitHub][1])
* **Community/profile** items are sparse (no contributing guide, code of conduct, issue templates, security policy). ([GitHub][2])
* Usage is oriented to **one-off reproduction**: “run `python experiments.py`” to regenerate paper results; it’s not presented as a drop-in optimizer for common ML workflows. ([GitHub][1])

### Who would use it (as-is)?

* **Optimization/ML theory folks** reproducing plots and constants from the paper or studying the proofs.
* **Students** in a theory/optimization course needing a reference implementation tied to the manuscript.

### Who probably won’t (as-is)?

* **Practitioners** training models in PyTorch/TF/JAX who expect a plug-and-play `Optimizer` class, tutorials, Colab notebooks, and benchmarks against SGD/Adam on standard tasks (CIFAR/ImageNet/NLP).

### Main adoption blockers

1. **Packaging gap**: no pip/conda install; no `Optimizer` interface for PyTorch/Keras/JAX. ([GitHub][1])
2. **Docs/tutorials lacking**: README is minimal; no quickstart/Colab; no API docs. ([GitHub][1])
3. **Licensing ambiguity**: MIT on GitHub but README text says “academic use only.” Clarify to avoid legal uncertainty. ([GitHub][1])
4. **Community signals**: no issues/PRs/templates; no CI; no releases, which reduces trust for production use. ([GitHub][1])

### What would make people use it (prioritized, concrete)

1. **Ship a PyPI package** (`pip install psd-optimizer`) with a **PyTorch `torch.optim.Optimizer`** wrapper and examples (MNIST/CIFAR).
2. **Add a Colab notebook**: “10-minute PSD quickstart” with reproducible seeds and plots.
3. **Clarify license**: ensure README matches the MIT file (or change the LICENSE if “academic only” is intended). ([GitHub][1])
4. **Publish a tagged release** (e.g., `v0.1.0`) and add **GitHub Actions CI** to run tests and style checks on pushes/PRs. ([GitHub][1])
5. **Benchmarks**: wall-clock comparisons vs SGD/Adam/PGD on at least two public datasets; report accuracy, time, and memory.
6. **Docs site** (e.g., MkDocs) with API reference, “Theory ↔ Practice” mapping (how to set $\varepsilon,\delta,T,r$), and troubleshooting.
7. **Community hygiene**: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue/PR templates, Code of Conduct, Security policy — these raise confidence and reduce friction. ([GitHub][2])

### Verdict

* **Current likelihood of use:** *Low outside research reproduction*. The repo is brand-new, minimally packaged, and not yet discoverable or turnkey for practitioners. With packaging, clearer licensing, tutorials, and benchmarks, it could find a niche among optimization researchers and curious practitioners. ([GitHub][1])
